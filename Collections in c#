Collections in c#
Array--Array is used to storing a data of fixed size and there are some drawbacks using array so collection useful instead of that.
Array drawbacks-
-increasing size of array
-inserting array element into the middle
-deleting or removing values in middle of the array
so we can use collections to overcome these.

Non-Generic collections:
System.Collections:Stack,Queue,ArrayList,LinkedList,SortedList,Hashtable
its not type safe, it accept object value so we can store different types values.

Array vs ArrayList:
Fixed Length				                Variable length
Not possible to insert items in middle      we can insert items in the middle
Not possible to delete items in middle     we can delete items from the middle 

ArrayList- 
	methods:Capacity- Check capacity of list. Capacity start with size of datatype and it becomes double when you add data. ArrayList is Auto sizing
Insert- to add element in middle at any index.
Remove- remove with value in ArrayList
RemoveAt- remove by index of element.

Hashtable-
it stores value in hash value so values are not in stored manner so how it storing in hashtable with hash value it retriving back on that basis.

 
Generic Collection:
It is type safe collection with auto resizing functionality

System.Collections.Generic:List,
