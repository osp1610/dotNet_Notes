Serialization:It is a mechanism used to
maintain the state of the data during 
transfer of information from source(mobile,laptop)
to destination(File,db,memory)

Converting object to stream of data which
can be transferable over network.This data
will be back to object once reached the
specific destination.

In industry 4-5 serialization techniques
-->Compatible to around world.

Deserialization:Saving data drom stream 
to object

Note:Only serialized data can be deserialized

Serialization techniques:
1.Binary Serialization--Supports serialization(in binary) for both public and private Properties.
2.SOAP Serialization--Supports serialization(in XML with SOAP Headers) for both public and private. Properties
3.XML Serialization--Supports serialization(in plain XML) for only public Properties
4.JSON Serialization--Supports serialization(in JSON Key value Pair) for both public and private Properties
5.Custom Serialization--User defined serialization used as per their needs.

Binary Serialization implemented with BinaryFormatter
SOAP Serialization implemented with SOAPFormatter
XML Serialization implemented with XMLFormatter
JSON Serialization implemented with JSONFormatter


In dotnet Serialization can be implemented using
System.Runtime.Serialization-->Namespace
System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary-->BinaryFormatter
System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap-->SoapFormatter
