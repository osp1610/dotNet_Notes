There are four main categories of sql statements:
DDL,DML,DQL,DCL,TCL

1. DDL:
*DDL commands are used to define and manage the structure of the database.
*Create,Drop,Alter,truncate are the DDL commands.

-Create:
It is used to create new database or object.


-Alter:
it is used to alter the structure of the database.



-Drop:
it is used to delete the objects from database.


-Truncate:
it is used to remove all records from the table.

-Rename:
we can use the sp_rename system stored procedure to rename a table in SQL Server.


2. DML:
*DML statements are used for manipulating data within the database, such as inserting, updating, and deleting records.

-Insert
Insert is used to insert data into table.


-Update
Update is used to update records from the table on particular condition

-Delete 
It is used to delete the record from table on particular condition.

*Difference Between DDL and DML
DDL:It is auto commited. Once query done it saved as permanently.
DML:It is not auto commited. It can not be saved permanently.


3.DQL:
-Select:
DQL statements in SQL Server are used for querying data from one or more tables. DQL statement is SELECT, which allows you to retrieve data from the database.


4.DCL:
-DCL is a subset of SQL that deals with the control and management of database access and permissions. DCL statements are used to specify who can access the database, what actions they can perform, and on which database objects (e.g., tables, views, stored procedures) they can perform these actions.
-Grant:
 -The GRANT statement is used to give specific privileges or permissions to database users or roles. 
-Privileges may include the ability to perform actions like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or even create objects within the database.
-GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON Employees TO User1;

-Revoke:
-The REVOKE statement is used to remove previously granted privileges from users or roles. It revokes the specific privileges that were previously granted
-REVOKE INSERT ON Employees FROM User1;



5.TCL:
-TCL (Transaction Control Language) is a subset of SQL used to manage transactions in a relational database management system (RDBMS). 
-Transactions are sequences of one or more SQL statements that are executed as a single unit of work. 
-TCL statements allow you to control the beginning, ending, and management of transactions
-BEGIN TRANSACTION (or BEGIN):
-It is used to start new transactions. It considered as begining of SQL statements are treated as single unit.
-BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-COMMIT:
-The COMMIT statement is used to save all the changes made during a transaction. 
-When you issue a COMMIT, all the changes become permanent and are stored in the database. 
-If the transaction is successful, the changes are committed, otherwise, they are rolled back.
-COMMIT;

-ROLLBACK:
-The ROLLBACK statement is used to undo all the changes made during a transaction and restore the database to its state before the transaction began. 
-It is typically used when an error occurs during the transaction and you want to discard the changes.
-ROLLBACK;
