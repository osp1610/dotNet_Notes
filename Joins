***Joins***
-To retrive data from more than one instance of table we need to use joins.
-Join always fetch matyching records.
-In sql server you perform joins using theta model(where clause) OR ANSI-SQL(Using jon keyword)Model.
-To join "N" tables we need to use minimum (n-1) table join condition.
-Equi or inner or join--This will fetch only matching record from the table.
-In a well-designed relational database, data is often distributed across multiple tables to eliminate data redundancy and maintain data integrity. Each table typically represents a specific entity or concept (e.g., customers, orders, products).
-SQL joins allow you to retrieve and display data from these normalized tables as a coherent whole, making it easier to work with structured data 
-When you need to retrieve data from multiple tables related by common columns (such as foreign keys), SQL joins allow you to combine the relevant information into a single result set.

Types of Joins:

-Inner Join:
-Returns only the rows that have matching values in both table.
Example:
select Employees.City, Company.OfficeID from Employees 
	inner join Company
	on Employees.EmpID=Company.EmpIds
	where Company.EmpCount>=80;

-LEFT JOIN:
-Returns all rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table. 
-If there's no match, NULL values are returned for the right table.
-Example:
select Employees.FirstName, Company.OfficeID from Employees
	left join Company
	on Employees.EmpID=Company.EmpIds
	where Company.EmpCount<=80;

-RIGHT JOIN
-Returns all rows from the right table and the matching rows from the left table. 
-If there's no match, NULL values are returned for the left table.
Example:
select Company.OfficeID,Employees.FirstName, Employees.LastName from Company
	right join Employees
	on Company.EmpIds=Employees.EmpID
	where Company.EmpCount>=100;

-FULL JOIN:
-Returns all rows when there is a match in either the left or right table.
-If there's no match, NULL values are returned for the table without a match.
-Example:
SELECT Employees.FirstName, Employees.LastName, Company.OfficeID, Company.EmpCount
    FROM Employees
    FULL JOIN Company ON Employees.EmpID = Company.EmpIds
	where Company.EmpCount=100;

-SELF JOIN:
-A self-join is used to combine rows from a single table. It's like joining a table with itself.
-Example:
select E1.FirstName,E2.LastName from Employees E1
	Inner join Employees E2 on E1.EmpID=E2.EmpId;

-CROSS JOIN:
-Returns the Cartesian product of two tables, i.e., all possible combinations of rows from both tables.
-Example:
SELECT Employees.FirstName, Company.EmpCount
	FROM Employees
	CROSS JOIN Company
	where Company.EmpCount>=100;
