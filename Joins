Joins-
-To retrive data from more than one instance of table we need to use joins.
-Join always fetch matyching records.
-In sql server you perform joins using theta model(where clause) OR ANSI-SQL(Using jon keyword)Model.
-To join "N" tables we need to use minimum (n-1) table join condition.
-Equi or inner or join--This will fetch only matching record from the table.

--------------------------
*student name city marks and garde of the student
select * Grade,Name,Marks,city
from studentgrade sg, student s
Where s.marks between sg.Lowrange and sg.Highrange
or
where sg.Marks >=sg.Lowrange and s.Marks<=sg.Highrange

-Non-Equi Join-using other than"=" operator to retrive data
 fom more than one table. this can be achived only using theta model
 

-----------------------------------------
Self Join-same table have primary and forigen key. 
*Query to display Name Age BirthCity ParentName CurrentRole

select * h.Name, h.Age,h.BirthCity, p.Name,h.CurrentRole
from human h join human p
on h.parentId=p.Id

------------------
cross join-if no relation still you want to retrive the data you will retrive bt you will get all the data.
           it will do all combination from both the table.
