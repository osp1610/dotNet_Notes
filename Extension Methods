Extention Methods:
New feature from c# 3.0

Inheritance is a mechanism using which 
we can extend functionalities of class

But one thing is there if it is a sealed
class then we cannot inherit it.

If the we want to do changes in struct but
struct cannot inherit

To overcome all these problems microsoft
introduce Extention methods

Extention Methods:
It is mechanism of adding new methods into
an existing class or struct also without 
modifying the source code of original type
and in this process we dont require any
permission from original type and the 
original type doesnt require any recompilation.


In extention methods we are going to 
create one static class first

Every method in a static class must be a static
method.

Example

namespace A
{
	class B
	{
		public void Method1()
		{
			Console.WriteLine("M1");
		}

				public void Method2()
		{
			Console.WriteLine("M1");
		}
		
		public static void Main()
		{
			B b = new B();
			b.Method1();
			b.Method2()
		}

		
	}
}



Now I am creating extention class

namespace A
{
	static class B
	{
		//Byusing this keyword we can pass 
		this method to class B
		public void Method3(this B b)
		{
			Console.WriteLine("M3");
		}
		
	}
}




{
	class B
	{
	public static void Main()
	{
		B b = new B();
		b.Method1();
		b.Method2();
		b.Method3();//Extention method
	}	
	}
}


In extention method we can bind Extention
method using this keyword which is pass
as a parameter in extention class

Extention methods are defined as static
but when they are bound with any class or
structure they change into non-static

If an extention mwthod is defined with 
same name and signature of an existing 
method then it only call existing method
give prefrence to original method.

If i want to pass parameter in extention
method i can pass it

public void Method3(this B b,int i)//In this way we 
can pass parameter
		{
			Console.WriteLine("M3");
		}

The first parameter of the extention method
is a name of class with 'this' keyword as prefix
it is always in the first place 
After that we can pass parameters.


Note:If extention method calling n parameter
then at the time of decleartion we need to
pass n-1 parameter becuase this keyword is 
ignored.

Extention method should have only one 
binding parameter

We can do it in a sealed classes also.

We can add extention methods in sytem defined
classes also.
For eg.Adding Factorial funaction in Int32 struct
