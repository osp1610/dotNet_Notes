JIT in dotnet

-JIT compiles code compiled by language specific 
compiler which is in the form of MSIL or CIL or IL
then MSIL converts it into native code which is 
machine dependent code

Types of JIT compiler
1.Pre JIT- When all source converting into machine
code at the same time single compilation cycle using 
pre-jit compiler.
This compilation process done at deployment time
and compiler always implemented in the Ngen.exe
(Native image generator)

2.Normal JIT compiler
The source code method that required at runtime
are compiled into machine code the first time 
they are called by the normal JIT compiler.
After that they are stored in cache and used whenever
it calles again

3.Econo JIT Compiler
The source code required at run time are compiled 
into machine code by Econo JIT compiler after this 
methods are not required anymore,they are removed
This compiler is no more used from dotnet 2.0

Advantages of JIT
1.uses less memory
2.Page faults are reduced
3.Code optimization based on statistical analysis

Disadvantages of JIT
1.Requires more startup time while executing initially
2.Cache memory is heavily used by the JIT compiler

These Disadvantages are handled by AOT(Ahead of time)
compilation.
