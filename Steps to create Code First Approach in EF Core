Steps to create Code First Approach in EF Core:

1. Create .NET Core Application (Console Application)

2. Add 3 Namespaces to the project

3. You have to create classes in VS that will migrate to Relational table (create properties along with relationship)

4. Use DataAnnotations to create necessary constraints that will get created in the DB after migration (using attributes, data annotations will perform the data validations/constraints)
 
Using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotation

5. Create context class with necessay dbset along with connection string that contains the datbase connection details

6.In the package manager console type below commands (this is for the first time)

    i.  dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef --> press enter (only for the first time)

    ii. dotnet tool update --global dtonet-ef --> press enter. You will get update success message. (Don't forget to close and reopen the application in VS) (When ever you want to update)

    iii. dotnet ef --> Press enter. It will tell you the version of dotnet ef (Always)

7. Write Migrate commands to update changes in VS has to applied in Data Source (DB)

PMC --> Add-Migration <<Migration Name>>

Ex: Add-Migration EFCoreDB --> Press enter --> It will start migrate and establish the connection with db (Will not create any table)

8. To make structure creation/changes --> type the below statement

Update-Database

9. You can interact with databse using LINQ to Entity syntax

10. To perform any DML actions (Insert/Update/Delete) --> Make sure make necessary changes in the Dbset using DBContext and update these changes back to db using SaveChanges() method.
